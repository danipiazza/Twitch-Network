# Twitch Network
## Goal of the project
The projects aims to analyze the graph and find the most influential streamers, communities and also run language/topic prediction of the streamers.


### Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: 
    - Read the data
    - Create the graph
    - Add attributes to the nodes
    - Add weights to the edges
    - Add language and topic of the streamer
    - Save the graph

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Analysis on the attributes of the graph
    - Number of nodes
    - Number of edges
    - Average, minimum and maximum degree
    - Degree distribution
3. Network Analysis:
    - Degree centrality
    - Betweenness centrality
    - Closeness centrality
    - Eigenvector centrality
    - Clustering coefficient
    - Density
    - Comparison with random graph
4. Community Detection:
    - Louvain method
    - Greedy modularity optimization
5. ML Models:
    - Reccommendation system
    - Language prediction
    - Topic prediction
